#### Eclipse Scripting API

To quote Varian's own guide to ESAPI:

```
Eclipse Scripting API (ESAPI) is an Application Programming Interface (API) that is built into the
EclipseTMtreatment planning system. This API allows developers to create C#.NET scripts, DLLs,
and programs that can read and operate on patient data loaded in EclipseTM, or on all patients in
the Eclipse database
```


#### Some useful resources:
- The Varian [developer](https://varianapis.github.io/) site
- A useful online [book](https://varianapis.github.io/VarianApiBook.pdf) which is quoted from above.
- [pyESAPI](https://github.com/VarianAPIs/PyESAPI): This is a Python front end to ESAPI. Note that this doesn't seem to be activley maintained
