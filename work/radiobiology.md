### Radiobiology Notes

Nick/Anna gave introductory talk (via Teams) on 2/12/24

- Best book is "Basic Clinical Radiobiology" edited by G. Gordon Steel

- Early/Late effects
- 5 (or 4+1) Rs of Radiobiolgy
- Linear Quadratic (LQ) model and alpha/beta ratios
- BED and EQD2
- Hypo  and hyper fractionation
- Accelerated fractionation

### Early/Late effects
- Radiation kills cells, however it's not that simple
- Survival curves are useful and can be plotted on a linear or log scale
- ED90 is the dose tha kills of 9-% of the cells
- Need to be getting to 0.001 level (i.e. killing practically all the cells
- Inadequate treatment (i.e. not enough dose) of a tumour leads to temporary _regression_ but followed by _recurrence_

### 5 (or 4+1) Rs of Radiobiolgy

- Repair
  - Cells recover in the hours after treatment, majority of DNA breaks repair within 15 mins to 4 hours
  - This can be evidenced by split dose and delayed playing experiments. Less cell death when dose split into two fractions
- Reassortment
  - Relates to the cell cycle
  - In G2 and M phases cells are much more sensetive to radiation damage
  - Cells in a population will be in differeing parts of the cycle
- Repopulation
  - During an extended course of RT surviving cells may proliferate (Good for normal tissue but bad for tumour cells)
  - For tumours this means more cells to kill
- Reoxygenation
  - Oxygenated tissue is more radiosensetive, hypoxic tissue is more radioresistent
  - Tumour cells may start as hypoxic but become oxygenated as outer tumour cells are killed

- Radiosensetivity
