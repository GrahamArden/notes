### Radiobiology Notes

Nick/Anna gave introductory talk (via Teams) on 2/12/24

- Best book is "Basic Clinical Radiobiology" edited by G. Gordon Steel

- Early/Late effects
- 5 (or 4+1) Rs of Radiobiolgy
- Linear Quadratic (LQ) model and alpha/beta ratios
- BED and EQD2
- Hypo  and hyper fractionation
- Accelerated fractionation

### Early/Late effects
- Radiation kills cells, however it's not that simple
- Survival curves are useful and can be plotted on a linear or log scale
- ED90 is the dose tha kills of 9-% of the cells
- Need to be getting to 0.001 level (i.e. killing practically all the cells
- Inadequate treatment (i.e. not enough dose) of a tumour leads to temporary _regression_ but followed by _recurrence_

### 5 (or 4+1) Rs of Radiobiolgy

- Repair
- Reassortment
- Repopulation
- Reoxygenation

- Radiosensetivity
