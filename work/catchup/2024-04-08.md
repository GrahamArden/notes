## Monthly catchup with Carl
2024-04-08

### News
-
### Gains
- Limbus has now gone clinical and appears to be going well. Worked with Anna to create breast templates and rules although this will now feed in to the wider "Breast Task Force" arranged bt Tom.  Meeing arranged with Athina to look at brachytherapy/MRI contouring..

### Quick Wins
- Trying to be more orgainised. Now using a combination of [GitHub](https://github.com) and markdown files to keep notes of things beinf worked on.

### Challenges
- Need to get up to speed on breast planning. Suggest putting aside 2 days per week (when not rota'd to do other tasks). Aim would be to get signed off for both breast and prostate planning


### Ideas
- Arrange to shadow assessor (Liz McCauley?) for next [MPACE](https://www.ukas.com/accreditation/standards/mpace/) assesment. Assesment beginning on 16/4. Email Richard asking him to contact Liz re shadowing.
- Carl will arrange another meeting with Marcus and David regarding [ProKnow](../proknow/README.md) scripts to compare across ODN
- Discuss with Tom use of SunCheck API.  Will also discuss with Paul getting https access set use (maybe using self issued certificates?)
