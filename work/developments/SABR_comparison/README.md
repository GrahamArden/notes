### Comparing plan criteria pre and post change to planning (and across the ODN)

Need to be able to compare a number of statistics for SBAR patients treated before and after the change in practice using ProKnow

- Mandatory
  - PTV Dmax

- Nice to have
  - PTV = V90%, V100%, volumes of PTV
  - ITV = Dmax, mean dose, V90%, V100%
  - Chest wall = D0.1cc, D3cc, D30cc.
  - Lung = V20Gy, Mean dose
  - Conformity index
  -  Max dose to 2cm ring from PTV

#### Problems

- Currently some of the PTVs are named PTV1, PTV2 etc and hence are ot in the appropriate collections
  - Can copies of the PTV1 etc be made as "PTV". This will then allow the scorecards to work.
