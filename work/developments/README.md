### Developments

### Proknow
I am currently working on the use of [Proknow](../proknow/README.md) and am a member of the [ProKnow scripting Task and Finish group](https://github.com/nhs-proknow)

As part of this we are looking at installing [miniconda within the VLAN](../proknow/conda_in_the_vlan.md) so that scripts can be run directly against both ARIA and Proknow

### SABR comparisons
[Compare SABR plans](./SABR_comparison/README.md) after increasing maximum dose to 140% of prescribed using ProKnow


Dave and Marcus at Leeds are developing a [tool](./DVH_tool.md) to compare DVH dta across the ODN


### Dosimetry
The dosimetry group are currently looking at extending the use of [Failure Mode and Effects Ananlysis (FMEA)](./FMEA/README.md)
