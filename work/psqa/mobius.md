- Select the appropriate patient from the left hand column

- If appropriate, the settings for the plan may be changed by selecting the "cog" icon at the bottom of the left hand column
- Parameters for the 3D Gamma can then be changed (e.g. to 5%, 3mm for Level2) and then "Recalculate Plan Check" selected at the bottom of the page.
- If changing to Level 2 a comment should be added in the notes at the bottom of the page. Examples are given below:
- - ``` Level 2 pass. Split carriage and mixed energy plan, therefore appropriate to accept at Level 2. 3D gamma reviewed and acceptable```
  - ``` Level 2 pass.  3D gamma reviewed and acceptable.  PTV passes criteria. Failing points are low and within the lung.```
- Once the plan has been recalculated go into External Beam Planning and run the "Mobius" script to produce a short summary report.
- Import into "Documents" and, assuming a pass at Level 2, approve the report.
- Select the appropriate PTVs
- Failures at Level 2 should be referred to an MPE
- Parameters for each level are given in TP-PRT-2
