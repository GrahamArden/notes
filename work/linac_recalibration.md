# Linac calibration

Reference conditions for Linac photon calibration (6MV, 15MV, 10FFF and 6FFF) at Castle Hill are as follows:

- 10 x 10 cm field
- 95 cm FSD
- 5 cm depth
- Water/solid water

An initial calibration is carried out in solid water, followed by a subsquent _independent_ calibration check in the small water tank.

The independent must be completely independent. i.e. carried out by a different physicist using a different chamber, electromter, cable, thermometer and barometer.

At least one set of measurements should be carried out by, or under the direct supervision of, an MPE.
