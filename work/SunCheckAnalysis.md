)
Looking at PTV and Body gamma
- Approve without comment for Level 1
- Add comments for Level 2 pass and above
- If fails at Level 2 involve an MPE
- Leave the current metric on the level it passes at when producing report

# Fraction 0

Look at results and approve if passing:

Be careful over average pass. Tolerance for overall pass is based on average of all arcs. Check individual arcs also pass for Level 1. Can go on a "reasonable" mean for Level 2.
