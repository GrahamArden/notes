### In-Vivo Dosimetry Preperation (Fraction n setup)

Work instruction:  TV-PRC-3

Export the patient plan to Suncheck
- _For "plan of the day" treatments (e.g. Bladder) export all the plans except the setup plan_

Schedule images (DC Integrated) for each fraction. Set panel to +50 cm (although this can be increased if necessary to avoid collision)
- _For "plan of the day" treatments the radiographers will schedule the images when sceduling the plan_
- _Add a note in Patient Alerts "Plan also for in-vivo. When scheduling please add an [MV Integrated] image to each arc"_

Add an "In-Vivo 1st Fraction analysis" between the "New Start" and third "Daily Treatment" tasks.

Add an "In-Vivo Final Report" task to the "Last Fraction"

_Note: If a patient has more than 1 phase then all phases should be prepared as some PH1/2 patients don't have multiple care paths_
