### In-Vivo Dosimetry Preperation (Fraction n setup)
_Note: This task is now done the Duty Physicist for that day. We are currently only doing Fraction n on Truebeam paients. If a patient has been scheduled on Halcyon, delete the "In-Vivo Dosimetry Preration" task_

Work instruction:  TV-PRC-3

Export the patient plan to Suncheck
- _For "plan of the day" treatments (e.g. Bladder) export all the plans except the setup plan_

Schedule images (DC Integrated) for each fraction. Set panel to +50 cm (although this can be increased if necessary to avoid collision)
- _For "plan of the day" treatments the radiographers will schedule the images when sceduling the plan_
- _Add a note in Patient Alerts "Plan also for in-vivo. When scheduling please add an [MV Integrated] image to each arc"_

Add an "In-Vivo 1st Fraction analysis" between the "New Start" and third "Daily Treatment" tasks.

Add an "In-Vivo Final Report" task to the "Last Fraction"
