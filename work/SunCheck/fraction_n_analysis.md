### Fraction n analysis

_See TP-PRT-2 Patient Specific Quality Control Protocol_

Look at results and approve if passing (_Make sure that the Level is set to the lowest that passes. This should normally be Level 1_)

Fraction 1 should always be checked before Fraction 3 is delivered. A report will only be printed following the end of treatment.

If Level 1 fails (particularly on a single field), try changing threshold from 10% to 20% and recalculate. If then passes record as a Level 1 pass: The template may be cahnged in the future

If changing the threshold still results in a fail (or if it was already set to 20%) further investigation will be required.

- Check journal to see if a dosimetric assessment has already been undetaken. If this is the case it _may_ be appropriate to set the baseline image to the one aquired on the day of the DA (for example if a shape change was noted)

- Check any CBCT acquired for the prescence of bowel gas (or the absence of gas that was present on the planning CT), or a change in the patient contour (in which case a DA may be appropriate).

A pass at level 2 may be approved, a pass at Level 3 ~~will require discussion with an MPE~~ which meets the additional criteria in TP-PRT-2 may also be passesd without consulting an MPE.

When approving, always leave the level at the one that passes.
