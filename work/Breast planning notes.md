Remember:

- Delete reference point location
- Delete MLCs from setup fields

### Split carriage for large fields (X>14cm)

An X field size of 14cm will require the use of split carriages and result in the following message when the plan is calculated

Once the plan has been optimised, set the plan to "Planning Approved" to create the sub fields and then back to "Unapproved". Rename the split fields appropriately e.g. RT LAT ANT and RT LAT POST.
