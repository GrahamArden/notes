### ProKnow Scripting QA

One thing that has been discussed recently at the ProKnow T&F group is the development of QA tools to check that plans have been assigned to the correct national collections

- Marcus and Dave at Leeds have been looking at checking laterality [based on the _average gantry angle_ for a plan](https://github.com/nhs-proknow/LeedsProKnowScriptsAndTools/tree/main/LateralQA)
- Another approach would be to look at any couch shifts in the plan to check for laterality. This should work in the majority of cases as long as the PTV is not central.  This is the approach I intend to work on
- The best approach may be to combine both methods to reduce the uncertainly.
