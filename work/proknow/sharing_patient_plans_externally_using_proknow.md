### Sharing patient plans externally using ProKnow
 
This is adapted from a method suggested by Marieke Van Der Putten at Newcastle

- Export plan to ProKnow
- Open plan in ProKnow
- Click "actions" on RHS of screen
- Go to "Manage Access"
- Add user (search by name/email address) with role set to "Contributor"
- This will allow the user to see the un-anonymised patient and download any plans/other objects to import into their planning system
