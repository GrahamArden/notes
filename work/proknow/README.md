### ProKnow

#### Scripting T&F group
I am a member of the IPEM ProKnow scripting T&F group. We have a GitHub [repository](https://github.com/nhs-proknow)

I have a [set of scripts](https://github.com/nhs-proknow/HullProknowCollectionScripts) which we currently use to assign plans to the national collections but I'm not happy with them and [am currently rewriting them](https://github.com/GrahamArden/Hull_tandf_scripts/tree/main) to use the [modules](https://github.com/nhs-proknow/proknow-scripting-tandf) that Liam Stubbington has created.

The next step will be to look at [installing conda (probably miniconda in the VLAN](conda_in_the_vlan.md))
