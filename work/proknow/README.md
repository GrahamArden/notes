### ProKnow

#### Scripting T&F group
I am a member of the IPEM ProKnow scripting T&F group. We have a GitHub [repository](https://github.com/nhs-proknow)

I have a [set of scripts](https://github.com/nhs-proknow/HullProknowCollectionScripts) which we currently use to assign plans to the national collections but I'm not happy with them and [am currently rewriting them](https://github.com/GrahamArden/Hull_tandf_scripts/tree/main) to use the [modules](https://github.com/nhs-proknow/proknow-scripting-tandf) that Liam Stubbington has created.

As part of this I'm looking at some more [scripting developments](./scripting_developments.md)
- Adding [additional fields](https://github.com/orgs/nhs-proknow/discussions/8) to include those required by Varian (and possibly other) users
- Modifying the modules so that [Pandas dataframes](https://github.com/GrahamArden/notes/blob/main/work/proknow/scripting_developments.md#modifying-the-modules-to-use-pandas-dataframes-in-addition-to-csv-files) may be used in addition to .csv files
- Using [additional data from ARIA](https://github.com/GrahamArden/notes/blob/main/work/proknow/scripting_developments.md#integrating-aria-and-proknow) to improve the assignment to collections

The next step will be to look at [installing conda (probably miniconda in the VLAN](conda_in_the_vlan.md))

A the end of January 2024, NHS England held a ProKnow Learning Event. [Notes](proknow/20240111_proknow.md) are available.
