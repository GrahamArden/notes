Meeting held via Teams on 11/01/2024

ProKnow learning event.
Presentations recorded (but not questions)

### Chris Walker: Overview of ProKnow (Progress with PN)

- Cloud based software
- Allows us to store plan data
- Tools for analysis
-- can enter data through custom metrics
-- can compare performance with objectives (scorecards)
-- can plot data

#### Good rate of adoption
- 3300 patients (16% in last month)
- 91% from 25 providers
- 15 providers nothing in last month
- 8 less than 20 pts
- Some progress with recent collections
- Some other collections created for other groups (e'g' NAtional Cardian SABR collection)

#### Scorecard
- unfortunate terminology. nobody is making a value judgement on your planning ability
- developed by expert reference groups where concensus data not readily availabe

### Ami Mehta: Developemnt od National Tumour Site Dosimetry Metrics

- Working grpup of tumour site-specific 
- Draft scorecards by IPEM groups
- Testd aand ammendments made

 DONT EDIT SCORECARDS

 H&N, bladder, CYA in development stage

 ### Nicki Whylde: Nomenclature

- PTOG is a multi disciplinary group
- Initially set up to commision nationally, outcome reports are in ProKnow
- Volunteered to support firther development
- PTOG still active, pursuionmg clinical projects

#### Nomenclature
- Reviewed TG263
- Reviewed Santanam et al 2012
- Recent clinical trials
- Other considerations

- PTVp : primary
- PTVn nodal
- PTVe elective
- PTVm metastatic disease

- Boosts identified through dose prescribed

Paper: Open RT Structures: A solution for TG-263 Accessibility

### Chris Walker: National Breast and Lung SABR collections

- Presented analysis 
- DIBH reduced heart dose!
- Heart doses on right lower than left :-)

#### Improvements:
- Improve upload of heart for right sided breast
- Harmonse nomenclature for Lung_L and Lung_R

### Michael Thomas (Sutton): Non uniformity of practice in breast RT: A first observation from ProKnow

- Observations from breast data set
- Implications locally and nationally
- Role of ProKnow

- Snapshot collected in September 2023

- 1460 rt and 1566 lt breast pts
- 22 trusts represented
- only 13 uploaded more that 10 rt sided pts
- mixture of partila/whole breast
- ProKnow meant that one person could collect this data and analyse in a few hours
- Even useful on local data
- Useful for building national concensus
- Breast will not be the only interesting site!

### Sarah Mission-Yates: Can treatment planning system beam modelling parameters predict Lung SABR plan

- Impact of beam modelling parameters
- TPS modelling parameters one of key reasons why audits fail
- Repeated for UK
