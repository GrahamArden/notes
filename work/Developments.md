### Developments

I am currently working on the use of [Proknow](proknow/README.md) and am a memnber of the [ProKnow scripting Task and Finish group](https://github.com/nhs-proknow)

As part of this we are looking at installing [miniconda within the VLAN](proknow/conda_in_the_vlan.md) so that scripts can be run directly against both ARIA and Proknow
