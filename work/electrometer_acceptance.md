#### Electrometer acceptance test measurements

- Linearity: Use timed measurements of charge from 1s up to 600s
- Cross calibration against other electrometers (Dose1 and DoseX) in terms of@
  - current (using check sources and 3 different chambers to give a range of values)
  - charge (pre and post brachytherapy source exchange)
 
  - Repeat constancy checks for _each_ of the chambers
