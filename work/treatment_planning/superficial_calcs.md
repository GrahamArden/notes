## Superficial (Xstrahl) calculations
Follow TP-PRC-5

_See tp-gd-67 for general guidance_

Useful documents

- Cutout BSF: TP-DAT-17 (use linear interpolation between measured values)
- Applicator BSF: TP-DAT-15
- Applicator output factors: TP-DAT-14
- Inverse square factors for 200 kVp: TP-DAT-37

Check the patient setup form to ensure the practitioner has specifed energy, applicator and appropriate cutout (_n.b. This may not be the most recent verion of the PMF, earlier revisions can be seen by right clicking on the document name. Check there have been no changes in the current version_)
