Minimum specifications (email from Stephen Chalkly-Pereira ):

"The minimum is being changed for v1.8. It’s not yet confirmed, but we suspect it’s Win10+ or Server 2019+, and 16Gb RAM+. Current recommendations have been Win10+/2016+/8Gb, but some customers have found the RAM to be a bit low. Our recommendations would be 20Gb RAM, but 16 will probably be fine."

Will be hosted on Compass servers:

- Compass2019 for Version 1.7 (Clinical version)
- Compass2021 for Version 1.8 (Testing version)

Check with Stephen about transferring config files. Can we export form one version to another. e.g. from V1.7 to 1.8.
