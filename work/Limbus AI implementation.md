Minimum specifications (email from Stephen Chalkly-Pereira ):

"The minimum is being changed for v1.8. It’s not yet confirmed, but we suspect it’s Win10+ or Server 2019+, and 16Gb RAM+. Current recommendations have been Win10+/2016+/8Gb, but some customers have found the RAM to be a bit low. Our recommendations would be 20Gb RAM, but 16 will probably be fine."

Will be hosted on Compass servers:

- Compass2019 for Version 1.7 (Clinical version)
- Compass2021 for Version 1.8 (Testing version)

Check with Stephen about transferring config files. Can we export from one version to another. e.g. from V1.7 to 1.8.

Tried to download current version 1.7.1 using link in email but blocked by firewall:

Emailed Freddie again to request alternative download. Sent another link which was also blocked. Contacted IT who just used Chrome to download rather than Edge.  Sent email to OIS Team and asked them to copy the install files to the VLAN.
