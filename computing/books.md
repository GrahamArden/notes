### Books
Generally I prefer real, physical, dead tree books, but that's just me

#### Computing
- [Data Science at the Command Line](https://jeroenjanssens.com/dsatcl/) is a good for just getting things done quickly 
Like all _good_ computer books it has it's own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jeroenjanssens/data-science-at-the-command-line)
