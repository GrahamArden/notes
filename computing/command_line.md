### Some useful command line tools

I like to use the [command line](https://jeroenjanssens.com/dsatcl/) to get things done efficiently.

Dealing with csv files (or even Excel) then you need [csvkit](https://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
- git repository here: (https://github.com/wireservice/csvkit)
- if your using [conda](../python/conda.md) then it can be installed using ```conda install csvkit```

For editing, I rather like [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) which works well in [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki). It also now [works](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim) with [copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)

It's also possible to use GitHub [Copilot](https://github.com/github/gh-copilot) on the command line

Sometimes I even [search](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Surfraw) directly from the command line
