### Some useful command line tools

I like to use the [command line](https://jeroenjanssens.com/dsatcl/) to get things done efficiently.

Dealing with csv files (or even Excel) then you need [csvkit](https://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), git repository here: (https://github.com/wireservice/csvkit)

Sometimes I even [search](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Surfraw) directly from the command line
