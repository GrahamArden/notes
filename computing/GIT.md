#### Removing a file or folder from a GIT repository (i.e. stop it being tracked and remove it from github)

- Locally Remove the Folder:

  - Open a terminal or command prompt.    
  - Navigate to the root directory of your local Git repository using the `cd` command.
  - Run the following command to remove the folder from the repository's history, replacing `foldername` with the name of the folder you want to remove.:

```bash
git rm -r --cached foldername
```

  - Commit the change:
```bash
git commit -m "Remove foldername from version control"
```

  - Push the changes to the remote repository on GitHub:

```bash
git push origin branchname
```


Yes, it is possible to clone only a specific directory from a GitHub repository into another Git repository. You can achieve this using the git subtree command or the git submodule command, depending on your specific requirements.

#### Using git subtree

Assuming you want to clone a specific directory called subdirectory from a GitHub repository into your existing Git repository, you can use the following command:

```bash

git subtree add --prefix=path/to/destination/folder --squash <repository_url> <branch>
```
Replace the placeholders
- <path/to/destination/folder>: The path where you want to place the cloned directory within your repository.
- <repository_url>: The URL of the GitHub repository,
- branch: The branch from which you want to clone the directory.

#### Using git submodule:
If you want to maintain a separate submodule for the directory you are cloning, you can use the git submodule command. This will allow you to keep the cloned directory in a separate Git repository within your main repository.

```bash

git submodule add -b <branch> <repository_url> path/to/destination/folder
```

Replace the placeholders 
- <branch>: the branch from which you want to clone the directory,
- <repository_url>: The URL of the GitHub repository.
- <path/to/destination/folder>: The path where you want to place the submodule within your repository.

After adding the submodule, you need to initialize and update it:

```bash

git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Choose the approach that best fits your use case, and adjust the paths and URLs accordingly. Keep in mind that when using submodules, the cloned directory will be in its own Git repository, and changes made within that directory should be committed and pushed separately in its own repository.
