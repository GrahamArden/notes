### Framewrok Laptop 13

I have now ordered a [Framework Laptop 13](https://frame.work/gb/en/laptop13) along with a [2TB NVRAM drive](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0B7CMZ3QH?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) and 64GB (2x[32GB](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BLTDTD86?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)) RAM.  
I intend to run [Arch Linux](../arch_linux/README.md) on it.
