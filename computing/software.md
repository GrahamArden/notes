### Software

Things I like to have installed, whether I'm working on [Arch Linux](../arch_linux/README.md) , [macOS](../macos/README.md) or Windows (which I use for [work](../work/README.md))

- A really [Awesome](https://awesomewm.org/) window manager (Obvioulsy this one is only for Linux).
- [Alacrity](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty), a terminal emulator, see also the Arch wiki [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Alacritty). I like to use the [GitHub Dark Dimmed](https://github.com/projekt0n/github-theme-contrib/blob/main/themes/alacritty/github_dark_dimmed.yml) theme.
- [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/) for (almost) all your of scientific computing needs
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) [(AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/visual-studio-code-bin) which, surprisingly, has now become my [favourite code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_86), particularly since the demise of [Atom](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/).
  - It's also pretty good for working with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)[ notebooks/lab](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)

- I also rather like [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) which works well in [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki). It also now [works](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim) with [copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
  - A useful getting started video is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHTeCSVAFNY)


- [Thunderbird](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Thunderbird) (I still haven't found anything I prefer for email, although it should be set to [use plain text](https://useplaintext.email/))
- The web browser [Firefox](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Firefox) hardened using [arkenfox/user.js](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/))
- [Thunar](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Thunar) A relatively fast, simple file manager
- zsh, and obviously, [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
  - I like using the [command line](https://jeroenjanssens.com/dsatcl/), particularly if I can use [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/wiki/blob/main/Cheatsheet.md)
- Some way of sorting out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles) The intention is to keep these in a [git repository](https://github.com/GrahamArden/dotfiles), probably using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)
  - See this useful [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6XCebnB9gs)

### File sharing
- Google Drive.
  - using [rclone](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/rclone/), particulary the [rclone mount](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/) command
  - [rclone/rclone: "rsync for cloud storage" (github.com)](https://github.com/rclone/rclone)
  - [How To Mount Google Drive Locally Using Rclone In Linux (ostechnix.com)][def]

- I can also [use rclone](https://rclone.org/dropbox/) for  [Dropbox](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dropbox)
- .... and probably Micrososoft [OneDrive](https://rclone.org/onedrive/)
