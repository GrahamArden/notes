My home network is connected to the internet via full fibre provided by [KCOM](https://www.kcom.com/). I'm actually quite pleased with the service I get from them. A number of other services are moving into the area as their monopoly is ending, but currently I see no reason to change.

Various services are provided on the network.  

Note that the links below will only work if your in my house (__Hey, who are you and what are you doing here?!__) or when connected via the VPN:

I'm having some problems with [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) at the moment. See [here](https://forum.syncthing.net/t/new-synology-dsm-7-syncthing-package-for-synology-nas/15702?page=2) for some possible answers.
