My home network is connected to the internet via fibre provided by [KCOM](https://www.kcom.com/). I'm actually quite pleased with the service I get from them. A number of other services are moving into the area as their monopoly is ending, but currently I see no reason to change.

Various services are provided on the network.  

Note that the links below will only work if your in my house (Hey, who are you and what are you doing here!) or when connected via the VPN:

| Host ip | name | OS | Used for... |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 192.168.1.1 | alpha.trigfa.org.uk |  | File server |
| 192.168.1. |  |  |  |

... fill in the table above
