### Computing
Some [books](./books.md#computing) I've found particularly useful

I have a [home network](./trigfa.md) which includes a number of servers (mostly using Raspberry Pi hardware)

Given the choice, I prefer [Arch Linux](../arch_linux/README.md) as an operating system, but also currently use [macOS](../macos/README.md) on my laptop.

I like to use the [command line](https://jeroenjanssens.com/dsatcl/) to get things done efficiently, sometimes I even [search](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Surfraw) directly from the command line

I use git for version control: [GIT tips etc](./GIT.md) including version control of this document

Sometimes if I'm too lazy to think I use [this](https://chat.openai.com)

Useful [DNS](./DNS_cheatsheet.md) commands

[up](README.md)
[top](../README.md)
