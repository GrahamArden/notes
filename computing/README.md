I have a [home network](trigfa.md) which includes a number of servers (mostly using Raspberry Pi hardware)

Given the choice, I prefer [Arch Linux](../arch_linux/README.md) as an operating system, but also currently use [macOS](../macos/README.md) on my laptop.

I like to use the [command line](https://jeroenjanssens.com/dsatcl/) to get things done efficiently

Sometimes I even [search](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Surfraw) directly form the command line

I use git for version control: [GIT tips etc](GIT.md) including version control of this document

Sometimes if I'm too lazy to think I use [this](https://chat.openai.com)

[Useful DNS commands](DNS_cheatsheet.md)
