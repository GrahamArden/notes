### Computing

Some of the [software](./software.md) I like to have installed.

Some [books](../books/README.md#computing) I've found particularly useful

I have a [home network](./trigfa.md) which includes a number of servers (mostly using Raspberry Pi hardware)

Given the choice, I prefer [Arch Linux](../arch_linux/README.md) as an operating system, but also currently use [macOS](../macos/README.md) on my laptop.

I like to use the [command line](./command_line.md) to get things done efficiently.

I use git for version control: [GIT tips etc](./GIT.md) including version control of this document

Sometimes if I'm too lazy to think I use [this](https://chat.openai.com)

If your system is broken then [this](https://www.system-rescue.org/) has proved useful in the past.

Useful [DNS](./DNS_cheatsheet.md) commands
