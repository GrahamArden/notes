I have a [home network](trigfa.md) which includes a number of servers (mostly using Raspberry Pi hardware)

Given the choice, I prefer [Arch Linux](../arch_linux/README.md) as an operating system, but also currently use [macOS](../macos/README.md) on my laptop.

I use git for version control: [GIT tips etc](GIT.md)

[PIVPN: Simplest way to setup a VPN](https://pivpn.io/) I use this on one of the [Raspberry Pis](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) to provide ad blocking along with a VPN into my home network. A useful guide is available at: [Install PiVPN with Wireguard on a Raspberry Pi with PiHole | by Abhineet Gupta | Medium](https://medium.com/@timebarrier/install-pivpn-with-wireguard-on-a-raspberry-pi-with-pihole-19d95ba8d206)
