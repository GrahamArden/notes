I have a [home network](trigfa.md) which includes a number of servers (mostly using Raspberry Pi hardware)

Given the choice, I prefer [Arch Linux](../arch_linux/README.md) as an operating system, but also currently use [macOS](../macos/README.md) on my laptop.

I like to use the [command line](https://jeroenjanssens.com/dsatcl/) to get things done efficiently

Sometimes I even [search](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Surfraw) directly form the command line

I use git for version control: [GIT tips etc](GIT.md) including version control of this document

I use [PIVPN](https://pivpn.io/) on one of the [Raspberry Pis](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) to provide ad blocking along with a VPN into my home network.
