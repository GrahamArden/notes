### Books
Generally I prefer real, physical, dead tree books, but that's just me

My favourite author, for both fiction and non fiction is [George Orwell](https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=george+orwell). Why? Becasue he [matters](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Why-Orwell-Matters-Christopher-Hitchens/dp/0465030505/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3IV28LHU04J17&keywords=why+orwell+matters&qid=1708100573&sprefix=why+orwell+%2Caps%2C91&sr=8-1)

A close second is [Iain Banks](https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=Iain+Banks&search_type=books) (although I can't really get into his Iain M Banks science fiction books)

That makes me sound like I only like _serious_ books but I also really enjoy a lot of detective novels including the "Thursday Murder Club" series by TV's Richard Osman. Yes, I can see the occasional plot flaw but the characters are engaging enough that I don't relly care.

#### Computing

- [Effective Computation in Physics](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-computation-in/9781491901564/) is a bit old now but still very useful. It also has a related [website](http://physics.codes/) and, as all good computing books do, a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/physics-codes/)
- [Data Science at the Command Line](https://jeroenjanssens.com/dsatcl/) is a good for just getting things done quickly 
Like all _good_ computer books it has it's own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jeroenjanssens/data-science-at-the-command-line)

- [Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) is good for [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), although it does seem to focus mainly on financial data. I have the second version, but the third version is now out.
