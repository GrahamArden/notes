### Right to Repair

I believe that if you own something then you have the right to repair it. That's the main reason I bought my [Framework laptop 13](../computing/framework_13.md)

Here are some useful resources:

- [The Restart Project](https://therestartproject.org/) helps people learn how to repair their broken electronics, and rethink how they consume them in the first place.

- [iFixit](https://ifixit.com) has guides and resources for repairing a whole range of items (not just computers).

- Louis Rossmann's [Consumer Action Taskforce](https://wiki.rossmanngroup.com/wiki/Main_Page) wiki is slowly growing
