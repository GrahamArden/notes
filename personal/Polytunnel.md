We now have a [Polytunnel](https://directplants.co.uk/10ft-x-12ft-straight-sided-polytunnel-kit-heavy-duty-professional-greenhouse/) ~~Now I just need some time to put it up.~~ and Tom has helped me to put it up

Might be worth looking at Dupapost galvanised fence post from [here](https://justthejobsupplies.co.uk/) for the fence at the bottom of the garden.
