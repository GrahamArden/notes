# My tiny toolkit

I have started making up my own [tiny toolkit](https://tinytoolk.it/) as I think it's really useful to be able to repair things 'in the field', including literally 'in a field' when we are camping.

Stuff I have in it so far:

## Stuff that screws
- A nice [ratchet screwdriver](https://tinytoolk.it/tools/wera-838-ra-s/)
- A set of Wera bit's to go with it.

## Stuff that solders
- I have a portable usb soldering iron on order
- A desoldering gun
