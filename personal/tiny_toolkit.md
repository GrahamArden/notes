# My tiny toolkit

I have started making up my own [tiny toolkit](https://tinytoolk.it/) as I think it's really useful to be able to repair things 'in the field', including literally 'in a field' when we are camping.

I have used a large [Lihit pencil case](https://cultpens.com/products/lihit-lab-triple-pen-case) in a rather fetching maroon camo from Cult Pens.  The current contents are as follows:

## Things that screw

- A nice [ratchet screwdriver](https://tinytoolk.it/tools/wera-838-ra-s/)
- A set of Wera bit's to go with it.
- Framework combined T5 screwdriver/spudger (expensive but it comes with a free [laptop](../computing/framework_13.md))

## Things that turn

- [Knipex Cobra XS 87-125 pliers wrench](https://tinytoolk.it/tools/knipex-cobra/)
- Bacho 150mm/6" adjustable spanner
- small 4mm socket set and ratchet handle

## Things that cut

- A cutting mat (cut down from an A5 one so it fits in the pouch)
- A snap-off blade knife
- Spare snap-off blades
- [CK electrician's scissors](https://www.primetools.co.uk/product/ck-492001-heavy-duty-electricians-scissors-140mm-soft-cable-tape-ties/)
- Small wire cutters

## Things that solder

- A Pinecil [soldering iron](https://tinytoolk.it/tools/pinecil-soldering-iron/)
- A desoldering gun
- 2 small tins containing solder and tip cleaner

## Things that hold

- Needle nose pliers
- Long nose tweezers

## Things that measure

- A small extendible tape measure which I've had for years. I removed the belt clip to make it even smaller
- A 15cm steel rule
- A cheap multimeter

## Things that compute

- Openterface Mini-KVM
- USB C-to-C cable
- UBB C-to-micro cable
- Short HDMI-to-HDMI cable
- USB C-to micro adaptor
- USB memory sticks with [System Rescue CD](https://www.system-rescue.org/) and [Arch Linux installer](https://www.archlinux.org).
