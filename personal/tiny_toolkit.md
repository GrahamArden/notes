# My tiny toolkit

I have started making up my own [tiny toolkit](https://tinytoolk.it/) as I think it's really useful to be able to repair things 'in the field', including literally 'in a field' when we are camping.

Stuff I have in it so far:

## Things that screw
- A nice [ratchet screwdriver](https://tinytoolk.it/tools/wera-838-ra-s/)
- A set of Wera bit's to go with it.

## Things that cut
- A cutting mat (cut down from an A5 one so it fits in the pouch)
- My old multitool

## Things that solder
- I have a portable usb soldering iron on order
- A desoldering gun

## Things that measure
- A small extendible tape measure which I've had for years.. I removed the belt clip to make it even smaller
- A 15cm steel rule
