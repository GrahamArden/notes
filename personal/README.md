# Personal notes

These are my non-work related notes. It may become useful.

### Travel

- A first attempt at a [Travel checklist](travel_checklist.md). This is mainly aimed at travel abroad but includes the list of tech stuff to take.
- A checklist for trips in our [camper](camper_checklist.md). This is _in addition_ to the one above when travelling in our van.
  - There is a [Campervan cooking](camper_cooking.md) page with a list of cooking equipment and basic food items that we keep in the campervan.
- A [Packing list](packing_list.md) for clothing, toiletries etc.

One of these trips, will be when we visit [Krankenhaus](https://krankenhausfestival.com/) at the end of August

### Garden
We have a [Polytunnel](Polytunnel.md)
