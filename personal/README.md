These are my non-work related notes. It may become useful.

### Travel

- A first attempt at a [Travel checklist](travel_checklist.md). This is mainly aimed at travel abroad
- A checklist for trips in our [camper](camper_checklist.md). This is _in addition_ to the one above when travelling in our van.

One of these trips, will be when we visit [Krankenhaus](https://krankenhausfestival.com/) at the end of August

### Garden
We have a [Polytunnel](Polytunnel.md)
