# Personal notes

This is the more interesing stuff

## Travel

- This is my [Travel checklist](travel_checklist.md), mainly aimed at travel abroad but includes the list of tech stuff to take.
- A [Packing list](packing_list.md) for clothing, toiletries etc.
- A checklist for trips in our [camper](camper_checklist.md). This is _in addition_ to the one above when travelling in our van.
  - There is also a [Campervan cooking](camper_cooking.md) page with a list of cooking equipment and basic food items that we keep in the campervan.

One of these trips, will be when we visit [Krankenhaus](https://krankenhausfestival.com/) at the end of August
