# Right to Repair

I believe that if you own something then you have the right to repair it. That's the main reason I bought my [Framework laptop 13](../computing/framework_13.md)

Here are some useful resources:

- [The Restart Project](https://therestartproject.org/) helps people learn how to repair their broken electronics, and rethink how they consume them in the first place.

- [iFixit](https://ifixit.com) has guides and resources for repairing a whole range of items (not just computers).

- Louis Rossmann's [Consumer Action Taskforce](https://wiki.rossmanngroup.com/wiki/Main_Page) wiki is slowly growing

Of course, to repair stuff you need a [toolkit](./tiny_toolkit.md). The most useful tools are [the ones you have on you](https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-265-the-tiny-tool-kit-manifesto#t=513).
