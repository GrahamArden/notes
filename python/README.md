#### Python

I like [Python](https://www.python.org) and I use the Python scientific distribution [Anaconda](http://www.anaconda.org) both at work and home

Anaconda (and it's trimmed down version [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/)) has a useful command line interface using the command [conda](conda.md).

#### This is a list of useful hints (many of them nicked from ChatGPT):

- How to use [f-strings](f-strings.md) to make print/error statements easier to read.

- Using [a list of dictionaries](list_of_dictionaries.md) means that dictionary items can have more than one definition. This was useful with the NHS national prostate definitions used in [ProKnow](https://nhs.proknow.com)

- We can use [named tuples](named_tuples.md) to define simple classes.
- Adding a [modules](add_directory_to_system_path.md ) directory to the system path
