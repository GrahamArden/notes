  
To define a collection that can contain two alternative definitions in Python, you can use a list to store multiple dictionaries representing the alternative definitions. Here's an example based on  one of the ProKnow NHS national prostate collections:

```python
prostateCollections = {

    "NHS35_Prostate_37.5/15_or_42/20" : [
        {
            "Dose" : 37.5,
            "Fractions" : 15,
        },
        {
            "Dose" : 42,
            "Fractions" : 20,
        }
    ],

    # Add other prostate collections as needed
}

```

In this example, the key "NHS35_Prostate_37.5/15_or_42/20" maps to a list containing two dictionaries, each representing an alternative definition. You can easily extend this structure to include more alternative definitions if needed.

When accessing the collection, you can iterate through the list of dictionaries to retrieve the alternative definition

```python
# Example of accessing the collection
collection_key = "NHS35_Prostate_37.5/15_or_42/20"
alternative_definitions = prostateCollections[collection_key]

for alternative_definition in alternative_definitions:
    print("Dose:", alternative_definition["Dose"])
    print("Fractions:", alternative_definition["Fractions"])
    print("-----")

```
