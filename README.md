### Notes

This is a repository for keeping notes , both for personal and work use.

At the moment, I use [Obsidium](https://help.obsidian.md/Home) as a note taker, but the beauty of using [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for notes is that I can change to a different, preferably open source, editor in the future. Alternatively I can just edit the .md files in any text editor (or even on Github).
