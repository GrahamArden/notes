# Notes

This is a repository for keeping notes.  Sometimes, if I'm stuck for an answer, I use [this](https://chat.openai.com). There is now a seperate private repository for [work notes](https://github.com/GrahamArden/work_notes/blob/main/README.md)

The beauty of using [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for notes is that I can edit the .md files in any text editor (or even on [Github](https://github.com/GrahamArden)).
  
## Computers

- [General computing stuff](./computing/README.md)
- [Framework Laptop 13](./computing/framework_13.md) because you should be able to fix things you own.
- [Network](./computing/network.md)
- Some useful [software](./computing/software.md)

## Programming

- [Python](./python/README.md)
- [Eclipse Scripting API](./esapi/README.md)
- For version control I use [GitHub](https://github.com/GrahamArden), either within [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) or on the [command line](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli/github-cli/about-github-cli)

## Operating systems

- [Arch Linux](./arch_linux/README.md)
- [MacOS](./macos/README.md)

## Other _probably more important_ home stuff

- [Personal](./personal/README.md) includes stuff on travel, camping, gardening (and some useful checklists)
- If you own it, you should be allowed to [repair it](./personal/right_to_repair.md)
- I like [books](./books/README.md)
