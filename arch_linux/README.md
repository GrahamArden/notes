# Arch Linux
I've been using Linux now since the mid 1990s, starting with Slackware and settled about 2012 with [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) (after trying Red Hat, Ubuntu, Debian and too many other distributions to remember).  

Arch even has an intsaller now (sort of!). A good guide to using it is available [here](http://formatting-kindle.info/arch.txt)

This is a space to keep my notes on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) (and Linux generally)

Arch is a rolling release so usually the software should be up-to-date.

I currently run Arch on my desktop (An old [Dell Optiplex 3020](https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-uk/product-support/product/optiplex-3020-desktop/overview) given to me by my son) and a [Framework Laptop 13](https://frame.work/gb/en/laptop13). 

The [Framework 13](../computing/framework_13.md) also has a useful [repair manual](https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Framework_Laptop) available on [ifixit.com](https://ifixit.com).

I run Wayland along with [hyprland](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hyprland). My configuration is based on the excellnt work done [here](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles)

Here is a list of some of the [software](../computing/software.md) I like to have installed.

[Packages](./arch_packages.md) to install (in particular what Python libraries i tend to require)

I also run a few [Raspberry Pis](https://www.raspberrypi.com) around the house, mainly running [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/) which is [Debian](https://www.debian.org) based.
