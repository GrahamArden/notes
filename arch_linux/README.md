### Linux
I've been using Linux now since the mid 1990s, starting with Slackware and settled about 2012 with [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) (after trying Red Hat, Ubuntu, Debian and too many other distributions to remember).  

I also run a few Raspberry Pis around the house, mostly running [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/) which is Debian based.

This is a space to keep my notes on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) (and Linux generally)

Arch is a rollong release so usually the software should be up-to-date.

I currently run Arch on my desktop (An old Dell given to me by my son) and am also thinking on buying a refurbished [Thinkpad 480](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T480-Windows-Ultrabook/dp/B0BY937M5D/ref=sr_1_3?crid=XQ7X1LGKMLSP&keywords=Thinkpad+T480&qid=1706192632&sprefix=thinkpad+t480%2Caps%2C64&sr=8-3) laptop to run it on as well.

Here is a list of some of the [software](Software.md) I like to have installed.
