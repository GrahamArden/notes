Things I like to have installed on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)


- A really [Awesome](https://awesomewm.org/) window manager (well, I like it).
- [Alacrity](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Alacritty), a terminal emulator
- [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/) for (almost) all your of scientific computing needs
- [Visual Studio Code (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/visual-studio-code-bin) which, surprisingly, has now become my favourite code editor, particularly since the demise of [Atom](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/).

- Google Drive. 
	- using [rclone](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/rclone/), particulary the [rclone mount](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/) command
	- [rclone/rclone: "rsync for cloud storage" (github.com)](https://github.com/rclone/rclone) 
	- [How To Mount Google Drive Locally Using Rclone In Linux (ostechnix.com)](https://ostechnix.com/mount-google-drive-using-rclone-in-linux/)

- I can also [use rclone](https://rclone.org/dropbox/) for  [Dropbox](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dropbox)
- .... and probably Micrososoft [OneDrive](https://rclone.org/onedrive/)
- [Thunderbird](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Thunderbird) (as I still haven't found anything I prefer for email)
- The web browser [Firefox](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Firefox) hardened using [arkenfox/user.js](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/))
- [Obsidian](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/obsidian-bin) for an easy way to edit these files. I can keep the notes in a git repository and it runs on Windows (in work), my Macbook and under Arch Linux.
- [Thunar](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Thunar) A relatively fast, simple file manager
- zsh, and obviously, [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- Some way of sorting out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles) The intention is to keep these in a git repository
