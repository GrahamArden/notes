Things I like to have installed on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) (most of which I also use on [macOS](../macos/README.md) and Windows (which I use for [work](../work/README.md))

- A really [Awesome](https://awesomewm.org/) window manager (well, I like it).
- [Alacrity](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Alacritty), a terminal emulator
- [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/) for (almost) all your of scientific computing needs
- [Visual Studio Code (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/visual-studio-code-bin) which, surprisingly, has now become my [favourite code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_86), particularly since the demise of [Atom](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/).

- Google Drive.
  - using [rclone](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/rclone/), particulary the [rclone mount](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/) command
  - [rclone/rclone: "rsync for cloud storage" (github.com)](https://github.com/rclone/rclone)
  - [How To Mount Google Drive Locally Using Rclone In Linux (ostechnix.com)][def]

- I can also [use rclone](https://rclone.org/dropbox/) for  [Dropbox](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dropbox)
- .... and probably Micrososoft [OneDrive](https://rclone.org/onedrive/)
- [Thunderbird](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Thunderbird) (as I still haven't found anything I prefer for email)
- The web browser [Firefox](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Firefox) hardened using [arkenfox/user.js](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/))
- ~~[Obsidian](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/obsidian-bin) for an easy way to edit these files. I can keep the notes in a git repository and it runs on Windows (in work), my Macbook and under Arch Linux.~~ Well after struggling with Obsidian for a month, I now just edit the .md files in Visual Studio Code or on Github. Much easier.
- [Thunar](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Thunar) A relatively fast, simple file manager
- zsh, and obviously, [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
  - I like using the [command line](https://jeroenjanssens.com/dsatcl/), particularly if I can use [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/wiki/blob/main/Cheatsheet.md)
- Some way of sorting out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles) The intention is to keep these in a git repository
